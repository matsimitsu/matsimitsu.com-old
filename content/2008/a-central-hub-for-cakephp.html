Last week i was in the #CakePHP channel on irc.freenode.net when i noticed a discussion about someone who had created a component, but didn't want it posted on the bakery. He thought that his code wasn't up to par with everything else on the bakery. So he thought about posting it on his blog.

I can see why he didn't want to post it on the bakery. You can get a lot of critics there, but those are only there to help improve the thing you posted and can help you to write better code.

It got me thinking how scattered the information about Cake really is. There is, of course, <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org">the bakery</a>, but there are also the saved bookmarks on <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/cakephp">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/coop/cse?cx=006850030468302103399%3Amqxv78bdfdo">the custom search engine</a>, <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=UvxgjXa03BG245KdxQnzeQ">the superfeed</a> and a gazillion blog posts about cake. All containing really good components, helpers and tutorials.

But what i really want is a central hub for all of these great contributions to Cake. Right now i'm feeling that i only get to see a part of all that's good about cake and still miss out on a lot of good stuff. Shure if i need something i google it first before i create it myself, but there must be a better way to stay up-to-date about all that is cake.

The bakery is a good start, but there are a lot of people who don't want to post their stuff there, because they think it isn't good enough and there is a list on the CakePHP home page, but it only lists a few blogs and there are so much more.

I think it would help the community as a whole and give more attention to all the great CakePHP stuff out there.

What do you think? Does CakePHP need a central place for all stuff cake, or do you think it's fine the way it is. Or maybe you have a great idea to get people to post more of their content to the bakery?
Let me know in the comments!
