Last night i was thinking about the fact that in some cases i can't use bake to re-bake my views to contain a new field for example. CakePHP also wants you to not write the same code twice, but what about the views. Every time you add a field to your model, you either need to re-bake your views, or update both the edit and add template files. You could use $form->inputs(); but the helper creates form fields for database fields you probably want to keep hidden (_count fields for example).

I can think of two solutions for this problem, namely.

1. Go the partial way (like rails uses it). Basically you make an element with all the form fields you want to display and use the $this->renderElement in the view to display the form fields.

2. Define public fields in your controller and use those. An example below:

post has the following fields:
id, title, content, created, comments_count.

we only want the user to be able to edit the title, content and maybe the created fields.

in our controller we create a new var: "publicFields"

[sourcecode language='php']
var $publicFields = array('title', 'content', 'created');
[/sourcecode]

you can set this var in the beforeRender callback like this: (controller)

[sourcecode language='php']
function beforeRender(){
$this->set('publicFields', $this->publicFields);
[/sourcecode]

and in your view you render the inputs using the inputs function of the form controller like:
[sourcecode language='php']
<code>$form->inputs($publicFields);</code>
[/sourcecode]

this way you only have to add a new field in your database and in the $publicFields array and all your forms update automagically.

What do you use to reduce the amount of code you need to edit for a change in the database?
