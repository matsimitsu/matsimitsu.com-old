title: Serializeable behavior for CakePHP
excerpt: Store an array of values in one field.
tags:

For a project i'm working on i needed to serialize a number of arrays before they could be saved and since i don't like to serialize and un-serialize all those arrays in each controller action, i wrote a behavior to take care of this.

It serializes all array data before it is saved into the database and when you do a find it will unserialize all data(including related model data).
