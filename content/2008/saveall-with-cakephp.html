SaveAll in Cakephp


Since the new beta release for CakePHP there is a nice feature called saveAll and, like the name says, it saves all model data in a form. What this means is that you don't have to do nasty stuff in the controllers (like looping).

Lets make a simple todo list to demonstrate.

First we need a table named tasks.
It has an id, int(11) and a name, varchar(255).


<h3>Models</h3>

Now we set up the model task.php (in /app/models/task.php)
<pre><code>
<?php
class Task extends AppModel
{
 var $name = 'Task';
}
?>
</code></pre>


<h3>Controller</h3>
Next we set up the controller (in /app/controller/tasks_controller.php)
<pre><code>
<?php
class TasksController extends AppController {
  var $name = 'Tasks';
  var $paginate = array('limit' => 50, 'page' => 1);

  function index(){
    $this->set('tasks', $this->paginate('Task'));
  }

  function add() {
    if (!empty($this->data)) {
      $this->cleanUpFields();
      $this->Task->create();
      if ($this->Task->saveAll($this->data)) {
        $this->Session->setFlash('List saved');
        $this->redirect(array('action'=>'index'), null, true);
      } else {
        $this->Session->setFlash('List could not be saved');
        $this->redirect(array('action'=>'index'), null, true);
      }
    }
  }

}
?>
</code></pre>


You can see that there is nothing different here except for the $this->Task->saveAll($this->data);
That is where most of the magic happens. The other magic is in the views, lets look at add.ctp


<h3>Views</h3>

(/app/views/tasks/add.ctp)
<pre><code>
<div class="todos form">
<?php echo $form->create('Task');?>
  <fieldset>
     <legend><?php __('Add Tasks');?></legend>
  <?php
    echo $form->input('Task.1.name');
                echo $form->input('Task.2.name');
                // and so on...
  ?>
  </fieldset>
<?php echo $form->end('Submit');?>
</div>
</code></pre>

Note the task.1.name, this is to let the model know that there could be more tasks.
And that's basically it!

Tomorrow i'll make a post about the other feature of saveAll, saving related models.
