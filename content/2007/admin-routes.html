I had some issues today with the admin routes in the new cake version.

The problem was that i was using an admin route in the core (/app/config/core.php)
<pre><code>/**
 * Uncomment the define below to use CakePHP admin routes.
 *
 * The value of the define determines the name of the route
 * and its associated controller actions:
 *
 * 'admin'     -> admin_index() and /admin/controller/index
 * 'superuser' -> superuser_index() and /superuser/controller/index
 */
Configure::write('Routing.admin', 'dashboard');
</code></pre>

And in my routes file (/app/config/routes.php) i was using this:

<pre><code>
  Router::connect('/dashboard/', array('controller' => 'sites', 'action' => 'index', 'admin'=>'dashboard'));
</code></pre>

This didn't work out as planned, it gave an error about not beeing able to find a controller action (index(); instead of dashboard_index();

Turns out that in the new version you need to use prefix instead of admin, so the line should be:

<pre><code>
  Router::connect('/dashboard/', array('controller' => 'sites', 'action' => 'index', 'prefix'=>'dashboard'));
</code></pre>


Then in my app_controller (/app/app_controller.php) i had a function to switch to the admin layout if it was called in the url, but this changed also.

It used to be:

<pre><code>
  if (isset($this->params['dashboard'])) {
    $this->layout = 'dashboard';
  }

</code></pre>

But i had to change it to:

<pre><code>
  if (isset($this->params['prefix']) && $this->params['prefix'] == 'dashboard') {
    $this->layout = 'dashboard';
  }
</code></pre>

The reason for this is that it uses the prefix value from the routes file.
If you use the first example (the one with $this->params['dashboard']) the dashboard layout will not be set if there is no / after dashboard in the url (http://mysite.com/dashboard), because $this->params['dashboard'] will be empty.
Using the second example it will set the layout.

I also check if the prefix is dashboard, because you could be using more then one prefix.
