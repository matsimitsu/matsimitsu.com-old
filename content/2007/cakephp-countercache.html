As i've seen a few questions about the countercache behavior in the irc channel (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#cakephp" title="irc link for #CakePHP">irc://irc.freenode.net/#cakephp</a>) i've decided to make a quick tutorial.

<h3>What is countercache</h3>
CounterCache is used in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a> to count the number of children a model has. Say we have a model called Project and this model hasMany Documents. It would be nice to know the number of Documents for a Project without doing a Count. Well countercache does exactly this.

<h3>The database</h3>

Lets use this table for projects:

<pre><code>
--
-- Table structure for table `projects`
--

CREATE TABLE `projects` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  `description` text NOT NULL,
  `created` datetime default NULL,
  `updated` datetime default NULL,
  `documents_count` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM  DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;

</code></pre>

Note the documents_count column in the table Projects, this is where the behavior saves the count of the current number of documents.

<h3>The models</h3>

Project.php (/app/models/)

<pre><code>
<?php
// Project model
class Project extends AppModel
{

 var $name = 'Project';
 var $hasMany = array('Document'=>array('dependent'=>true));
}
?>
</code></pre>


and the document:

document.php (/app/models/)
<pre><code>
// Docment model
<?php
class Document extends AppModel
{

 var $name = 'Document';
 var $belongsTo = array('Project');
 var $actsAs = array('CounterCache');
}

?>

</code></pre>


<h3>How it works</h3>
Note that the $actsAs is in the child model (in this case documents). This is because the behavior basically does a count on each beforeSave and beforeDelete and stores it in the parent's model as <models>_count, in this case documents_count. Note that the model name is pluralized, so it becomes document<strong>s</strong>_count instead of document_count.


<h3>Where can i find the behavior?</h3>
Since this feature is not implemented yet (note this post was written on december 15, 2007). You can get the behavior at the bakery on: <a href="http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/countercache-or-counter_cache-behavior" title="Bakery link to CounterCache">http://bakery.cakephp.org/articles/view/countercache-or-counter_cache-behavior</a>.

When the feature does get implemented, you could just use it like this:

<pre><code>
var $belongsTo = array(
                        'Project' =>
                            array('className'   => 'Project',
                                'conditions'        => '',
                                'order'             => '',
                                'foreignKey'        => 'project_id',
                                'counterCache'      => 'projects_count'
                                )
                        );
</code></pre>
